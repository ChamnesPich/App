	<h3>PM's formula put to test</h3>
	<p>For the many who have pinned their hopes on Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha’s Cambodia National Rescue Party, it would be a crushing blow for the delicate alliance to have come so far only to split now.

Yet less than six months from the June 4 commune elections – the most important test yet of the nearly five-year-old experiment in placing the downfall of Prime Minister Hun Sen ahead of competing egos – the still-maturing marriage of convenience has never been so openly fractious.

From Sokha’s open rebuke of Rainsy’s refusal to leave the safety of Europe, to Rainsy’s obvious displeasure in giving up the title of parliamentary “minority leader” for Sokha, never before have the deep personal differences in the CNRP appeared so at risk of blowing up. (Last month, Sokha’s daughter even publicly taunted Rainsy as “Peter Pan” for his perceived childishness.)

It’s a familiar place for Hun Sen, who over his three decades in power made a name for himself as Cambodia’s great divider – slicing and dicing the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer People’s National Liberation Front, Funcinpec and anyone else who dared oppose him. So there is a wealth of experience for Sokha and Rainsy to draw on as they perform their latest three-person dance with the man they have sworn to remove from power by working together.

“I hope the two leaders will not fall into that trap again,” said Son Soubert, who has for legal purposes served as nominal leader of Sokha’s old Human Rights Party since its structure and membership was merged with that of Rainsy’s party to form the CNRP in July 2012.

“If they have learned from the past, this is what the prime minister has done: First, the CPP divided the KPNLF, and when they succeeded, they started to do it with Funcinpec, too. Now – I hope – the political parties should have learned their lesson,” he added.

However, Soubert, who is a former member of the Constitutional Council and son of late prime minister Son Sann, said that even though he has known Rainsy and Sokha for decades, he could not predict if the former fierce rivals could prove themselves different to past leaders.

“That is difficult to say. Human nature is that they both have reason – to think and to calculate – but they have also their egos and hearts,” Soubert said.

Both CNRP leaders should also be intimately aware of the relevant history, with Rainsy having his political roots in Funcinpec – for whom he was finance minister in the 1990s in coalition with the CPP – and Sokha having cut his teeth as a clandestine KPNLF operative in the 1980s.

Outside of its large youth following, the CNRP in fact still remains largely a latter-day regrouping of holdouts from both those movements, which had been both allies and rivals from their creation to their collapse at Hun Sen’s hands. And much of that divide remains.

The Sam Rainsy Party faction of the CNRP remains associated with the remnants of Funcinpec, from which the SRP split in the 1990s, as well as Rainsy’s personalist style, while Sokha’s HRP is heavily populated by former KPNLF figures, who touted their old party as more democratic.

As a founding Funcinpec member who now sits in Sokha’s faction and often criticises Rainsy, Prince Sisowath Thomico bucks that trend. He said that for all the personal differences between Rainsy and Sokha, he believed both were hyper-aware that they cannot win alone.

“I’ve said this many, many times before: Kem Sokha and Sam Rainsy cannot be divided, because if they split, they will both have no future. The CNRP has raised so much hope, so I do not believe in divisions between Sokha and Rainsy,” Thomico said.

“But what I am more concerned about,” the prince added, “is divisions between their supporters – not at the grassroots, but at the intermediary level. We have to remember that the CNRP is still a union of the Sam Rainsy Party and the Human Rights Party.”</p>
